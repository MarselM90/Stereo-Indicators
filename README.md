This project was made possible by building upon the work of others and with the help of modern tools.

Highpoint's Peakmeter Plugin: The core method for connecting to the webserver's audio stream was first demonstrated in the "Peakmeter" plugin by Highpoint. This was instrumental for the creation of Stereo Indicators.
Google's Gemini: This plugin was developed with significant assistance from the Gemini AI model for code generation, debugging, refinement, and documentation.
